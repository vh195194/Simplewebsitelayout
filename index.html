            <h1>This is a really interesting story about Dragon Balls frieza ark.</h1>
            <p>
                The Freiza ark from Dragon ball z was a story about an emperor who went around the universe claming planets. The emperor wanted to be immortal so he seeked the dragon balls to grant his wish so he went to this planet called namek and killed all the inhabitants on the planet in search of the dragon balls. He ran into the main charecters krillin gohan, vegeta, and piccolo he fought all of them. They were outmatched and were waiting for goku to help them out but he was being healed. By the time goku got there vegeta there strongest apart from goku was killed by frieza. Goku and frieza started to fight but goku was heavily outmatched.
            </p>

            <h2>This is what happens during it.</h2>
            <p>
                Goku has powered up to full power while frieza is at 25%. Goku uses his kaioken technique which boosts his power up by 2 but he boosted it by 10 and he still was outmatched. Goku decided to push his body to the limit and use kaioken x20 which he thought he killed frieza with but it wasn't enough. He then decided to use the spirit bomb which required time so piccolo held frieza off while goku charged it up. Goku ended up hitting frieza with the spirit bomb but it still wasn't enough. Piccolo and krillin were killed after that that angered goku and he awakened super sayain.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>Goku</li>
                 <li>Gohan</li>
                 <li>Freizar</li>
            </ul> 

            <h2>conclusion of frieza ark.</h2>
            <p>
                Goku and frieza then fought again but this time frieza was heavily outmatched. The super sayain form boosted his power by 50x frieza had to use his full power just to slightly match him. These two fighting was causing the planet to blow up so goku had ended up defating frieza but he gave him enough energy to survive but frieza tied to kill him with that energy but failed and died. Goku found a ship and used to get out of there before the planet blew up and he crash landed on some other planet.

            <h1>This is a really interesting story about the Cell ark from dargon ball z.</h1>
            <p>
                The cell ark from dragon ball z was about a android that was created to kill goku. This was after the frieza ark and it was about 3 androids who were sent to kill goku and his friends. At this time vegeta was dating bulma and they didn't have a son yet but there son from the future trunks came and warned them about this. They fought the two androids 17 and 18 they outmatched them but cell showed up from the future after killing trunks in a different timeline. He needed to absorb 17 and 18 to get stronger he was weak at first but after absorbing a bunch of humans he was able to match android 16 which was stronger than 17 and 18. 
            </p>

            <h2>Imperfect cell</h2>
            <p>
                Cell was able to absorb 17 and then went after 18 but vegeta and trunks stopped him. They got stronger by training in the hyperbolic time chamber which allowed them to get stronger faster. Vegeta was able to outmatch imperfect cell but he got cocky and let cell absorb 18. Then perfect cell was born and he was much stonger than vegeta and trunks. At that time goku and his son gohan where training in the time chamber.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>Gohan</li>
                 <li>Cell</li>
                 <li>Goku</li>
            </ul> 

            <h2>conclusion of the cell ark.</h2>
            <p>
                After goku and gohan where done training cell hosted the cell games he said if they couldn't defeat him he would destroy the solar system. The first one to fight was goku and he ended u putting up a good match against cell and he blew up the top half of his body but he was able to regenerate. Goku lost so his 12 year old son Gohan fought and 16 ended up being killed and that angered gohan and he awakened super saiyan 2. He outmatched cell so cell was going to blow himself and the planet up but goku teleported him and cell away to another planet killing both of them. But cell still was able to regenerate and came back stronger but still lost because it wasn't enough.

            <h1>This is a really interesting story about the Beerus ark from dragon ball super.</h1>
            <p>
                The Beerus ark from dragon ball super is after the buu ark which was after the cell ark. The beerus ark is about the god of destruction beerus waking up from his million year long nap about a dream of a super saiyan god. So his angel whis took him to goku and they fought and goku used super sayain 3 and got flicked on the forehead and almost killed from how stong beerus was. He then went to earth and fought vegeta who ended up the same as goku. he fought all of their freind using below 20% power.
            </p>

            <h2>The ritual</h2>
            <p>
                Beerus then summoned shenron using the dragon balls to tell him how to get goku to awaken the super saiyan god. Shenron said that they needed to do a ritual and have 5 people with saiyan blood to give their energy to goku at the same time. They did that and it worked. Goku awakened super saiyan god and was incredibly stong.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>vegeta</li>
                 <li>beerus</li>
                 <li>Goku</li>
            </ul> 

            <h2>conclusion of the beerus ark.</h2>
            <p>
                Beerus and goku then had a rematch and goku was able to take punches and ki blasts from beerus. They where fighting and were equaly matched. But then goku started to lose power and went into his base form but realized he absorbed it into his base form. There fight was destroying the universe so they ended it and goku lost but beerus was satisfied but only used about 60% of his power.

            <p>
                In this ark broly and his father escaped from planet vegeta before it was destroyed by frieza (this was a long time ago). They hated vegeta because he sent broly to a dangerous planet for being to strong. Broly trained and grew up on that planet and got really strong. Then a couple years later two of frieza's men picked broly and his dad up and frieza learned about their revenge plan so he allowed it.
            </p>

Then broly still kept getting stronger so vegeta powered up into super saiyan god and was able to beat him until broly powerd up again and outmatched him. But goku also wanted to fight and broly forced goku in super saiyan blue and goku was outmatched so vegeta went super saiyan blue aswell and they fought him at the same time but where still losing and freiza killed broly's dad angering him more and getting him even stronger.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>

            <p>
                Goku and vegeta needed to fuse to end up winning the fight. So they fused into gogeta and fought broly. They ended up outmacthing him in super saiyan blue. They were about to finish him but someone used the dragon balls to teleport him away to safety and that was the end.
