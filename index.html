            <h1>This is a really interesting story about Dragon Balls frieza ark.</h1>
            <p>
                The Freiza ark from Dragon ball z was a story about an emperor who went around the universe claming planets. The emperor wanted to be immortal so he seeked the dragon balls to grant his wish so he went to this planet called namek and killed all the inhabitants on the planet in search of the dragon balls. He ran into the main charecters krillin gohan, vegeta, and piccolo he fought all of them. They were outmatched and were waiting for goku to help them out but he was being healed. By the time goku got there vegeta there strongest apart from goku was killed by frieza. Goku and frieza started to fight but goku was heavily outmatched.
            </p>

            <h2>This is what happens during it.</h2>
            <p>
                Goku has powered up to full power while frieza is at 25%. Goku uses his kaioken technique which boosts his power up by 2 but he boosted it by 10 and he still was outmatched. Goku decided to push his body to the limit and use kaioken x20 which he thought he killed frieza with but it wasn't enough. He then decided to use the spirit bomb which required time so piccolo held frieza off while goku charged it up. Goku ended up hitting frieza with the spirit bomb but it still wasn't enough. Piccolo and krillin were killed after that that angered goku and he awakened super sayain.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>Goku</li>
                 <li>Gohan</li>
                 <li>Freiza</li>
            </ul> 

            <h2>conclusion of frieza ark.</h2>
            <p>
                Goku and frieza then fought again but this time frieza was heavily outmatched. The super sayain form boosted his power by 50x frieza had to use his full power just to slightly match him. These two fighting was causing the planet to blow up so goku had ended up defating frieza but he gave him enough energy to survive but frieza tied to kill him with that energy but failed and died. Goku found a ship and used to get out of there before the planet blew up and he crash landed on some other planet.
