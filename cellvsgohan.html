            <h1>This is a really interesting story about the Cell ark from dargon ball z.</h1>
            <p>
                The cell ark from dragon ball z was about a android that was created to kill goku. This was after the frieza ark and it was about 3 androids who were sent to kill goku and his friends. At this time vegeta was dating bulma and they didn't have a son yet but there son from the future trunks came and warned them about this. They fought the two androids 17 and 18 they outmatched them but cell showed up from the future after killing trunks in a different timeline. He needed to absorb 17 and 18 to get stronger he was weak at first but after absorbing a bunch of humans he was able to match android 16 which was stronger than 17 and 18. 
            </p>

            <h2>Imperfect cell</h2>
            <p>
                Cell was able to absorb 17 and then went after 18 but vegeta and trunks stopped him. They got stronger by training in the hyperbolic time chamber which allowed them to get stronger faster. Vegeta was able to outmatch imperfect cell but he got cocky and let cell absorb 18. Then perfect cell was born and he was much stonger than vegeta and trunks. At that time goku and his son gohan where training in the time chamber.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>Gohan</li>
                 <li>Cell</li>
                 <li>Goku</li>
            </ul> 

            <h2>conclusion of the cell ark.</h2>
            <p>
                After goku and gohan where done training cell hosted the cell games he said if they couldn't defeat him he would destroy the solar system. The first one to fight was goku and he ended u putting up a good match against cell and he blew up the top half of his body but he was able to regenerate. Goku lost so his 12 year old son Gohan fought and 16 ended up being killed and that angered gohan and he awakened super saiyan 2. He outmatched cell so cell was going to blow himself and the planet up but goku teleported him and cell away to another planet killing both of them. But cell still was able to regenerate and came back stronger but still lost because it wasn't enough.
