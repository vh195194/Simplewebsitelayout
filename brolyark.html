            <h1>This is a really interesting story about the Broly ark from dragon ball super.</h1>
            <p>
                In this ark broly and his father escaped from planet vegeta before it was destroyed by frieza (this was a long time ago). They hated vegeta because he sent broly to a dangerous planet for being to strong. Broly trained and grew up on that planet and got really strong. Then a couple years later two of frieza's men picked broly and his dad up and frieza learned about their revenge plan so he allowed it.
            </p>

            <h2>Power</h2>
            <p>
                They went to earth which broly then fought vegeta but was outmatched. then he powerd up and forced vegeta into super saiyan 2. Then broly still kept getting stronger so vegeta powered up into super saiyan god and was able to beat him until broly powerd up again and outmatched him. But goku also wanted to fight and broly forced goku in super saiyan blue and goku was outmatched so vegeta went super saiyan blue aswell and they fought him at the same time but where still losing and freiza killed broly's dad angering him more and getting him even stronger.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>vegeta</li>
                 <li>Broly</li>
                 <li>Goku</li>
            </ul> 

            <h2>conclusion of the broly ark..</h2>r
            <p>
                Goku and vegeta needed to fuse to end up winning the fight. So they fused into gogeta and fought broly. They ended up outmacthing him in super saiyan blue. They were about to finish him but someone used the dragon balls to teleport him away to safety and that was the end.
