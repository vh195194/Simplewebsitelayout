            <h1>This is a really interesting story about the Beerus ark from dragon ball super.</h1>
            <p>
                The Beerus ark from dragon ball super is after the buu ark which was after the cell ark. The beerus ark is about the god of destruction beerus waking up from his million year long nap about a dream of a super saiyan god. So his angel whis took him to goku and they fought and goku used super sayain 3 and got flicked on the forehead and almost killed from how stong beerus was. He then went to earth and fought vegeta who ended up the same as goku. he fought all of their freind using below 20% power.
            </p>

            <h2>The ritual</h2>
            <p>
                Beerus then summoned shenron using the dragon balls to tell him how to get goku to awaken the super saiyan god. Shenron said that they needed to do a ritual and have 5 people with saiyan blood to give their energy to goku at the same time. They did that and it worked. Goku awakened super saiyan god and was incredibly stong.
            </p>

            <h2>This is a list</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li>vegeta</li>
                 <li>beerus</li>
                 <li>Goku</li>
            </ul> 

            <h2>conclusion of the beerus ark.</h2>
            <p>
                Beerus and goku then had a rematch and goku was able to take punches and ki blasts from beerus. They where fighting and were equaly matched. But then goku started to lose power and went into his base form but realized he absorbed it into his base form. There fight was destroying the universe so they ended it and goku lost but beerus was satisfied but only used about 60% of his power.
